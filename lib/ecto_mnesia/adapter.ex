defmodule EctoMnesia.Adapter do
  @moduledoc """
  Ecto 2.X adapter for Mnesia Erlang term database.

  ## Run-Time Storage Options

    * `:host` - Node hostname.
    * `:dir` - Path where Mnesia should store DB data.
    * `:storage_type` - Type of Mnesia storage.

  ### Mnesia Storage Types

    * `:disc_copies` - store data in both RAM and on dics. Recommended value for most cases.
    * `:ram_copies` - store data only in RAM. Data will be lost on node restart.
    Useful when working with large datasets that don't need to be persisted.
    * `:disc_only_copies` - store data only on dics. This will limit database size to 2GB and affect
    adapter performance.

  ## Limitations

  There are some limitations when using Ecto with MySQL that one
  needs to be aware of.

  ### Transactions

  Right now all transactions will be run in dirty context.

  ### UUIDs

  Mnesia does not support UUID types. Ecto emulates them by using `binary(16)`.

  ### DDL Transaction

  Mnesia migrations are DDL's by their nature, so Ecto does not have control over it
  and behavior may be different from other adapters.

  ### Types

  Mnesia doesn't care about types, so all data will be stored as-is.
